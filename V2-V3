To monitor mode and packet injection in Kali Linux in TP Link WN227, follow these steps:

**1. Check your TP-Link WN227 version.** The TP-Link WN227 V1 supports monitor mode and packet injection out of the box, but the TP-Link WN227 V2 and V3 require custom drivers. To check your TP-Link WN227 version, run the following command:

```
lsusb | grep 8188eu
```

If the output shows `RTL8188EU`, then you have a TP-Link WN227 V1. If the output shows `RTL8812AU`, then you have a TP-Link WN227 V2 or V3.

**2. Install the necessary drivers.** If you have a TP-Link WN227 V2 or V3, you will need to install custom drivers. To do this, run the following commands:

```
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y realtek-rtl8188eus-dkms
```

**3. Enable monitor mode.** To enable monitor mode, run the following command:

```
sudo airmon-ng start wlan0
```

This will create a new interface called `mon0`.

**4. Inject packets.** To inject packets, you can use a variety of tools, such as `aireplay-ng` or `hcxdumptool`. For example, to inject a deauthentication packet to a client with the MAC address `00:11:22:33:44:55`, you would run the following command:

```
sudo aireplay-ng -0 1 -a 00:11:22:33:44:55 mon0
```

**5. Stop monitor mode.** To stop monitor mode, run the following command:

```
sudo airmon-ng stop mon0
```

This will disable monitor mode and restore your wireless adapter to its normal mode.

**Note:** You may need to run the above commands with root privileges. To do this, use the `sudo` command before each command.

**Additional tips:**

* Be careful when injecting packets. Injecting packets can disrupt other wireless networks, so it is important to only inject packets when you have permission to do so.
* If you are having trouble enabling monitor mode or injecting packets, you can try searching for help online or posting a question on Stack Overflow.
